# html5-canvas-physics
Physics demos built on ES2015 (ES6), babel, webpack, Redux and React. Yay!

## Running the application
Of course, make sure that you have a current version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
Any version after 4.0.0 should be fine. Personally, I like to use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) so that I can change my node version as needed.

Next, you need to clone the repo, and run `npm install`.

Once you have all of that, type `npm run dev` on the command line.
This will start the server on localhost:8080.

There are more build scripts defined in the package.json scripts section, if you're interested
in building your bundle for production.
